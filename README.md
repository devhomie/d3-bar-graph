# Creating a Bar Graph | With D3.js
  - We'll be creating a bar graph that visualizes the frequency of characters
    in a text box.
    - The bar graph will update as new text is typed or pasted into the box.
    - Creating this visualization will aid in practicing data joins, teach
      new techniques like drawing axes to contextualize the data.
